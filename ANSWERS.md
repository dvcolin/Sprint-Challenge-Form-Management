- [ ] What are the required parts of class components?

Class components require a `constructer()` which includes `super()`. State and properties of the class components are defined inside of the `constructor`. They also require a `render()` call which contains JSX.

- [ ] Why are forms used so often in web applications and software?

Forms allow users to sign up for new accounts, order something, send messages, etc. Any data that must be stored in a server is often created or accessed by using forms.

- [ ] What advantages are there by using a forms library like Formik?

Form libraries simplify the process of creating forms in React or other JavaScript libraries. We do not need to write our own `handleChanges` method, as this is included in Formik. In addition, we can add validation to our forms easily by using Formik and Yup.

- [ ] Why do we write tests for our apps?

We write tests for our apps in order to make them easier to debug and document what our app should actually be doing. Manually testing an application for bugs is very tedious and expensive, therefore, writing many unit tests makes it easier for all developers to identify where the bug is located. In addition, by including edge cases in our tests, we can ensure that users always have the best possible experience when using our app.
